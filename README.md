## 24-Points (Poker Games) 
Random withdraw 4 cards from a deck of poker cards (excluding jokers), come up with a variaty of ways to make equations by adding "+", "-", "*", "/" which result in 24.

## Warp-Quest
Rewrite an [old game](https://github.com/barbie6676/WarpQuestSolution) with interactable visualization. Given a 5x5 grid, move the target plane (one with a circle) to the destination (star) to unblock next level (18 levels in total). The each plane can be moved horitonzally or vertically towards another plane, if there is no stones (no-entry) in between the route.
